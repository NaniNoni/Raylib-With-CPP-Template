# Raylib with CPP Template
The Raylib with CPP Template is an easy way to start your Raylib adventure with an empty Raylib project configured to use C++.

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/NaniNoni/Raylib-With-CPP-Template
cd RAYLIB_VERSION_OF_CHOICE
```
Now run `make` to compile and run.

## Dependencies
Raylib With CPP requires the following program to be installed on your system:

## Why C++?
C++ supports object oriented programming, which is very useful for game development. By default, Raylib is meant for C, which doesn't have object oriented features.
