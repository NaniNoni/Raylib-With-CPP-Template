# Raylib++ Template for Windows

The Raylib++ Template for Windows is an easy way to start your Raylib adventure with an empty Raylib project configured to use C++.

## Dependencies

Raylib++ requires the following programs as dependencies to be installed on your system (and added to the `PATH` environment variable):

- gcc
- make

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NaniNoni/Raylib-With-CPP-Template
    cd RAYLIB_VERSION_OF_CHOICE
    ```

2. Run `make` to compile and run.

## Why C++?

C++ supports object oriented programming, which is very useful for game development. Raylib is a C library, and C doesn't have object oriented features.

## Versions

Raylib++ Template for Windows currently supports the following versions of Raylib:

1. 4.2.0
